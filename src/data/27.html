Circuit Description:

<p>

The text fixture above measures the ratio of collector current (Ic) to base
current (Ib) of bipolar transistors. A 3 position switch selects one of 3
base current conditions, 1mA, 0.5mA and 0.025mA. Collector current is
measured with a DMM connected across points A and B, and the hFE or gain
factor is determined by multiplying the DMM current reading by a factor of
1, 2, or 4 depending on the switch setting. For example, when the switch is
in the X1 position, the base current will be about 1mA and so the hFE value
will be the DMM reading directly. When the switch is in the X2 position, the
base current will be half a much, so the DMM reading is multiplied by 2,
or 4 if the switch in the 4X position. The supply voltage should be close
to 9 volts for fairly accurate measurements. Also, the transistor should be
removed from the fixture after each test to avoid excessive battery drain.
<p>
Base current is established with a series resistor which drops the supply
voltage minus the emitter to base voltage or about 9 - 0.6 = 8.4 volts.
The resistor value is worked out by dividing the resistor voltage (8.4) by
the desired base current. If the desired base current is 0.25 mA, the resistor
value will be 8.4/.00025 = about 33K which corresponds to the center open
switch position and labeled X4. When the switch is in the X2 position a
second 33K resistor is added in parallel for twice as much current. In the
X1 position a 11K resistor is added in parallel with one of the 33K resistors
for a total resistance of 8.25K which yields a base current of about
8.4/8.25K = 1.02mA.

The 51 ohm resistor is used to avoid blowing the DMM fuse (as I did)
in case the DMM is accidently connected across the supply while measuring
current. The 2 diodes are used so that either NPN or PNP transistors can
be tested and the collector voltage adjusted with the pot without the need
of a second switch. The supply connections need to be reversed for testing
PNP transistors.

The 1K pot in series with the collector allows adjustment of the collector
voltage so that readings can be made using various values. For example,
the data sheet of the 2N3904 shows a hFE of 100 minimum at 10mA collector
current and 1 volt collector voltage. If the transistor is used in a switching
application, the collector voltage will be lower at around 200 millivolts and
the hFE was measured to be 52 at 13mA. The collector voltage was adjusted to
200 millivolts using the 1K pot with the DMM measuring voltage across
points C and D. A few measurements made are listed below.
