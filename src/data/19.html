<center><h3>Temperature Range Indicator Using a Window Comparator</h3>
<p></center>

<pre>

A window comparator usually employs 2 comparators with one output indicating
the input is somewhere between two limits. In these examples, a third
comparator is added to display all three conditions where the input is in
the center range, or higher, or lower.

The first example uses a thermistor to indicate the temperature is near
68 degrees within about +/- 5 degree tollerance. The thermistor measures
33K at around 68 degrees and varies about 3570 ohms over a range of 10 degrees.
Using a 12 volt supply, the thermistor voltage will be 6 volts in the center
of the range. As the temperature increases 10 degrees, the total resistance
falls 3750 ohms, the current will be 12/ (66K -3750) =193uA and the thermistor
voltage will be 193u * (33k -3750) = 5.65 volts. This represents a voltage
change of (6 - 5.65) = 350 millivolts for a 10 degree change. The center resistor
of the window voltage divider must then drop 350 millivolts. Using 20K resistors
on the top and bottom of the window voltage divider produces a current of
(6 - (.350/2)) / 20K = 291uA, and the center resistor is .350/291u = 1.2K

When the temperature is in the center of the window range, the voltage at
pins 5 and 6 will be 1/2 the supply voltage, or 6 volts in this case.
The voltage divider (20K, 1.2K, 20K) produces a voltage of around 5.8 at
pin 4 and 6.2 at pin 7. Since the voltage at pin 5 (6 volts) is more positive
than the voltage at pin 4 (5.8 volts), the output at pin 2 will be a high
level. At the same time, the voltage at pin 7 (+ input) is higher than
pin 6 (- input) causing pin 1 to also be a high level. This condition
produces a high (12 volt) level at pin 10 (- input) which produces a low
level at pin 13, lighting the window LED indicating the temperature is in
the window range. As the thermistor voltage moves above the upper 6.2 limit,
pin 1 will switch low, extinguishing the window LED and illuminating the
(Low Temp) LED. Similar action happens as the thermistor voltage moves below
the lower 5.8 limit causing pin 2 to switch low (Over Temp LED) while the
other two LEDs remain off.

<center><h3>Light Level Indicator Using a Window Comparator</h3>
</center>
<pre>
The second example below uses a LDR (light dependent resistor) to indicate
some desired light level. The LDR has a large dynimic range and varies in
resistance from less than 100 ohms on a cloudy day to over a megohm in total
darkness. A 2K pot was used to adjust the window range for usual room light
conditions. This setup might also be used to indicate sunrise/sunset conditions.

The proto board picture below shows the circuit wired to measure light
level using a LDR and 2K potentiometer. The green (window) LED is lit
indicating the light level is about right to take the picture.
