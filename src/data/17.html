<center><h3>Infrared Remote Control Tester</h3></center>
<br>
This is a fairly easy circuit that can be used to test TV and VCR
remote controls. The infrared detector module (GP1U52X) (Radio Shack 276-137)
produces a 5 volt TTL pulse train corresponding to the digital code of the
particular remote control key pressed. In the lower circuit, the module
output is normally low with no signal received and becomes a positive
going pulse train when a signal is present. Other detector modules
are available that have an inverted output as shown in the upper drawing
which is the type I used, but I don't have the part number, I believe
it was removed from a VCR. The pulse sequence represents the digital code
of the particular key pressed along with possible manufacturer information.
As the pulse train occurs, the 4.7uF capacitor is charged to about 3 volts
and the capacitor voltage minus a diode drop appears across the 470 ohm
resistor yielding a collector current from the 2N3904 or 2N3906 of about
5 milliamps. The collector current of the first stage flows into the base
of the output transistor (MJE34 or 2N3053) which delivers around 250 mA into
the indicator lamps. When the pulse train ends, the capacitor slowly
discharges through the base of the first stage transistor allowing the Xmas
tree lights to remain on for a about 1 second. The little Xmas lamps will
operate over a wide voltage range, so you can use bulbs from almost any
string, but bulbs from shorter strings (35 or less) will probably last
longer operated at 5 volts.
<p>
The circuit can be powered from a small 9-12 volt DC, 250 mA or greater
wall transformer. It may also need an additional 1000 uF filter capacitor
across the DC output if the wall transformer does not have a built in
capacitor. For use with a 9 volt battery, the incandescent lamps can be
replaced with a regular LED and 680 ohm resistor and the output transistors
can be replaced with small signal transistors (2N3904 or 2N3906). The total
current drain will be about 25 mA with the LED lit, and 15 mA standby when
the LED is off.

<center><h3>Transistor Schmitt Trigger Oscillator</h3></center>
<br>
The Schmitt Trigger oscillator below employs 3 transistors, 6 resistors
and a capacitor to generate a square waveform. Pulse waveforms can be
generated with an additional diode and resistor (R6). Q1 and Q2 are
connected with a common emitter resistor (R1) so that the conduction of
one transistor causes the other to turn off. Q3 is controlled by Q2
and provides the squarewave output from the collector.
<p>
In operation, the timing capacitor charges and discharges through the feedback
resistor (Rf) toward the output voltage. When the capacitor voltage rises
above the base voltage at Q2, Q1 begins to conduct, causing Q2 and Q3
to turn off, and the output voltage to fall to 0. This in turn produces
a lower voltage at the base of Q2 and causes the capacitor to begin discharging
toward 0. When the capacitor voltages falls below the base voltage at Q2,
Q1 will turn off causing Q2 and Q3 to turn on and the output to rise to
near the supply voltage and the capacitor to begin charging and repeating
the cycle. The switching levels are established by R2,R4 and R5. When the
output is high, the voltage at the base of Q2 is determined by R4 in parallel
with R5 and the combination in series with R2. When the output is low, the
base voltage is set by R4 in parallel with R2 and the combination in series
with R5. This assumes R3 is a small value compared to R2. The switching
levels will be about 1/3 and 2/3 of the supply voltage if the three resistors
are equal (R2,R4,R5).
<p>
There are many different combinations of resistor values that can be used.
R3 should low enough to pull the output signal down as far as needed when
the circuit is connected to a load. So if the load draws 1mA and the low
voltage needed is 0.5 volts, R3 would be 0.5/.001 = 500 ohms (510 standard).
When the output is high, Q3 will supply current to the load and also current
through R3. If 10 mA is needed for the load and the supply voltage is 12,
the transistor current will be 24 mA for R3 plus 10 mA to the load = 34 mA
total. Assuming a minimum transistor gain of 20, the collector current for
Q2 and base current for Q3 will be 34/20 = 1.7 mA. If the switching levels
are 1/3 and 2/3 of the supply (12 volts) then the high level emitter voltage
for Q1 and Q2 will be about 7 volts, so the emitter resistor (R1) will be
7/0.0017 = 3.9K standard. A lower value (1 or 2K) would also work and provide
a little more base drive to Q3 than needed. The remaining resistors R2, R4, R5
can be about 10 times the value of R1, or something around 39K.
<p>
The combination of the capacitor and the feedback resistor (Rf) determines
the frequency. If the switching levels are 1/3 and 2/3 of the supply, the
half cycle time interval will be about 0.693*Rf*C which is similar to the 555
timer formula. The unit I assembled uses a 56K and 0.1 uF cap for a positive
time interval of about 3.5 mS. An additional 22K resistor and diode were used
in parallel with the 56K to reduce the negative time interval to about 1 mS.
<p>
In the diagram, T1 represents the time at which the capacitor voltage has
fallen to the lower trigger potential (4 volts at the base of Q2) and caused
Q1 to switch off and Q2 and Q3 to switch on. T2 represents the next event
when the capacitor voltage has risen to 8 volts causing Q2 an Q3 to turn off
and Q1 to conduct. T3 represents the same condition as T1 where the cycle
begins to repeat. Now, if you look close on a scope, you will notice the
duty cycle is not exactly 50% This is due to the small base current
of Q1 which is supplied by the capacitor. As the capacitor charges, the
E/B of Q1 is reverse biased and the base does not draw any current from
the capacitor so the charge time is slightly longer than the discharge.
This problem can be compensated for with an additional diode and resistor as
shown (R6) with the diode turned around the other way.

<center><h3>Battery Equal Charge Indicator</h3></center>
<br>

The circuit below illuminates an LED to indicate unequal charges
between two 12 volt lead batteries. It can be used to verify
that two batteries are connected in parallel or isolated since
the LED will be off when the voltages are equal within a tollerance,
or on if the voltage difference is greater than 100 millivolts.

Three comparators and three voltage dividers are used to determine
battery conditions. The upper left comparator (+) input at pin 5 is
set to about 10 volts with battery #1 at 12 volts. The negative input
(pin 4) is set to a slightly lower voltage by adding an additional
240 ohms to the voltage divider so that the output of the comparator
will be positive when both battery voltages are equal and negative
if battery 2 rises above battery 1 by 100 millivolts or more. The voltage
at pin 5 is used as a reference for the lower comparator and the
negative input of the lower comparator is set to a lower voltage
with the addition of 510 ohms, so that the output will also be positive
when the battery voltages are equal and negative when battery #1 is
greater than #2 by 100 millivolts or more. The two comparator outputs
are both connected to the positive input of the third comparator
at pin 9 so that the LED will illuminate when either condition
exists, <BR> (Battery #1 > Battery #2) OR (Battery #2 > Battery #1).

<center><h3>Salt Water Battery</h3></center>
<br>

About 13 years ago, I made a salt water battery to operate a single
AA battery quartz clock. It ran for several months until I got tired of
adding water to compensate for evaporation. The batttery consisted of
5 cells each producing about 300 millivolts. As I remember, I used 5
small olive jars filled with about a cup of water and a tablespoon of
salt to create 5 cells in series each producing about 300 millivolts for
a total of around 1.5 volts. The positive electrode was made from
a strip of double sided copper circuit board (about 1 inch by 4 inch)
and the negative electrode was a similar sized strip of aluminum. I
recently tried some galvanized iron instead of aluminum and found it
produces a little higher voltage so the battery may be made with only 3 cells.
But any two different metals used with salt water or citrus juice will
create a low voltage battery. You might experiment using silver coins
and copper pennies and various fruit juices to come up with a more powerful
battery.

The diagram below shows the 5 cells connected in series with the galvanized
iron of one cell connected to the copper piece of the next. The battery
produces a very low current of around 1 milliamp so it's not practical for
much other than a quartz clock. You might get a low current LED to light
using a few more cells and larger electrodes with greater surface area.
You might also add a capacitor across the battery to supply higher current
pulses for a flashing LED. It will probably operate the 1.5 volt
flashing LED circuits shown on the main menu at a slow flash rate.
