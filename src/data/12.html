<center><h3>Digital Clock with Timer and Solar Panel Regulator</h3></center>


This is a combination digital clock timer and solar panel charge
controller used to maintain a deep cycle battery from a solar panel.
The timer output is used to control a 12 volt load for a 32 minute
time interval each day. Start time is set using 9 dip switches
and ends 32 minutes later. The 32 minute duration is set by selecting
the 5th bit (2^5 = 32) of a 4040 binary counter (pin 2). The timer
also has a manual toggle switch so the load can be manually switched
on or off and automatically shuts off after 32 minutes. The time
duration can be longer or shorter (8,16,32,64,128,256 minutes etc.) by
selecting the appropriate bit of the counter. The timer circuit is
shown in the lower schematic just above the regulator.
<p>
The basic clock circuit (top schematic below) is similar to the binary
clock (on another page) and uses 7 ICs to produce the 20 digital bits
for 12 hour time, plus AM and PM. A standard watch crystal oscillator
(32,768) is used as the time base and is divided down to 1/2 half second
by the 4020 binary counter. One half of a 4013 data latch is used to divide
the 1/2 second signal by 2 and produce a one second pulse that drives the
seconds counter (74HC390 colored purple). The minutes are advanced by
decoding 60 seconds (40 + 20) and then resetting the seconds counter to 0
and at the same time advancing the minutes counter. The same procedure is
used to advance the hours. The second half of the 4013 latch is used to
indicate AM or PM and is toggled by decoding 13 hours and resetting the
hours to 0 and then advancing the hours to "one".
<p>
The clock display circuit is shown in the second drawing below and uses 6
more ICs to decode the binary data and drive four seven segment LED
displays. The 10s of hours digit is driven with a single 3904 transistor.
Two multiplexer circuits (4053) are used to manually select either
minutes or seconds for the right two display digits. The two switches
shown between the 4053s and below the left 4053 are both part of one
DPDT switch which selects either seconds or minutes for the 1X and 10X
digits. This switch is shown in the seconds position and the hours digits
are blanked with a low signal on pin 4 of the 4511. The display can also
be toggled on and off (totally blank) using a set/reset latch made from
a couple 74HC00 NAND gates. A momentary DPDT switch is used to control
the latch and toggle the display on or off. The second pole of this switch
is used on the upper drawing (connected to the run/stop switch) to set the
hours and minutes. Thus this same switch performs both functions of blanking
the display and setting the time. The run/stop switch is shown in the normal
running mode and supplies a low signal to a NAND gate which prevents accidental
setting the time while the clock is running. The run/stop switch also
turns on the display (through the diode D2) when in the stop position. The
procedure for setting the clock would be to set the (run/stop) switch the
stop position and the (seconds/minutes) switch to the minutes position. Then
toggle the momentary switch to set minutes and hours of the current time plus
one minute. The clock can then be started with the run/stop switch at
precisely the right time (+/- 0.5 seconds).
<p>
The voltage regulator in the lower drawing maintains the battery at
13.6 volts and also supplies the clock and timer circuits with 4.3 volts.
The charge LED indicator only comes on when the regulator is supplying
max charge to the battery. When the battery voltage reaches 13.6 the
regulator reduces the current to whatever is necessary to maintain the
voltage and the charge indicator will turn off. The unit I built also
included a battery condition indicator (voltmeter using 4 LEDs) to indicate
the battery condition so that a failure of the regulator would be indicated
by the charge indicator LED turned off and less than 4 LEDs lit on the
voltmeter. The 4 LED battery condition indicator is shown on another page.
